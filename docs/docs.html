<p>Yirgacheffe is a simple language designed to run on the JVM and is in many ways similar to Java. It lacks many of the features of the modern Java language and even some of Java's more traditional ones. However it is still possible to write good object oriented code in Yirgacheffe. Below are listed some of the features that Yirgacheffe lacks along with explanations of what can be used instead.</p>
<h3>Inheritance</h3>
<h3>Public Fields</h3>
<h3>Mutable Fields</h3>
<h3>Static Methods</h3>
<h3>Typecasting</h3>
<h3>Null Literals</h3>
<h3>Try/Catch Blocks</h3>
<h3>Switch Statements</h3>
<h3>Lambda Expressions</h3>
<h3>Multiple Number Types</h3>
<h3>Stream Processing</h3>
<p>That's not all. There are even more features that Yirgacheffe lacks such as wildcard types, checked exceptions and inner classes. You'll just have to do without them. It really is possible if you're clever enough. Have fun!</p>
